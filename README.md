About
===========
Generate valid CSS3 text that can be copied-n-pasted into your project. 

Description
-----------
A custom dojo AMD widget mashup of the dojox.widget.ColorPicker, with a hack to enable opacity, and my custom slider widgets to allow for the easy generation of CSS3 gradients.

Still a work in progress, this project is mostly an exercise for me to get more familiar with AMD, but you can download it and run it just by double clicking the index.html file.
